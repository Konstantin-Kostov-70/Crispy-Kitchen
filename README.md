## Crispy-Kitchen

### Overview
Crispy Kitchen is a dynamic website built using Django, designed for a restaurant business. The website serves as both a promotional platform and a content hub, featuring menus, special offers, blog posts about food, and customer interactions like reservations and comments. The project is structured into two main Django applications:

- **Crispy Kitchen (Main App)**: Handles menus, reservations, newsletter subscriptions, and customer messages.
- **Crispy Blog**: Manages blog posts related to food, where users can read and comment on news articles.

### Features

#### 1. Homepage
The homepage showcases a selection of **special menus** and **best offers**. It also includes recent **blog posts** from the `crispy_blog` app.

#### 2. Menus
- **Main Menu**: Lists all food items available at the restaurant, pulled from the `Menu` model.
- **Special Menu**: Highlights special offers with the ability to **like** food items. Each menu item can be viewed in detail, and users can express their preferences by liking the items.

#### 3. Blog Section
- Blog posts are managed under the `crispy_blog` app.
- Each post has its own **detail page** where users can read the post and leave comments.
- The blog uses the `Post` model to store entries, and users can comment using the `FoodComment` form.

#### 4. User Interaction
- **Food Likes**: Users can like or unlike food items in the menu.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on blog posts.
- **Reservation System**: A fully functional reservation form allows users to book a table. Upon submitting a reservation, a success message is displayed.
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Users can subscribe to a newsletter by filling out a form on the **About page**.

#### 5. Contact Page
- Users can leave messages for the restaurant using the **contact form**.

#### 6. Admin Section
- The site admin is accessible through a custom URL path (`/koss/`), with a honeypot feature protecting the default `/admin` route for enhanced security.

- To access the Django admin interface, navigate to the `/koss/` path on your local server, for example:

 - http://127.0.0.1:8000/koss/


## Security
The website implements several security features:

- **Django Honeypot**: Protects the default admin URL from potential attacks by redirecting `/admin/` to a honeypot.
